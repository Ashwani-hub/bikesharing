## Results

### Deployed Tableau Analysis



### Visualizations for August 2019



### Summary
Data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month analyzed. Majority of the rides were in Manhattan Island during morning and evening rush hours, which implies that the service may have been used as an alternative to public transport for commute to work.

Additional analysis on comparison data for different months to determine trends over the year and weather data to review correlation between the weather and the number of rides should be more benificial to determine the viability of the bike-sharing business
